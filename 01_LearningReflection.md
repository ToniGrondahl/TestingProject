> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- It was fine but the instructions were a bit confusing and hard to understand first.


## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?   

-I wrote my test cases by studying the given example application.


## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 
 - I don't have anything in mind right now.
    

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I didn't use an IDE but MacBooks TextEdit application.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I didn't find any major trouble, if something was confusing I studied the given material more. 
    

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- I didn't find trouble using Github since I have used it before during web development courses.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I would probably use Selenium because it supports multiple programming languages and all the major browsers and operating systems. There is also a strong community support for it and it's easy to learn and adopt. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- The most in-demand skills for Testers currently are: Good communication skills, good problem solving skills, understanding business requirements, good functional testing skills and good knowledge of automated testing tools.  
    
    
## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- Some technical skills that I would need are programming skills, frontend and backend skills, Writing automated tests, and overall knowledgew of different software testing tools
- Few soft skills that I would need are communication skills, problem solving skills, and adaptability.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

- The project did help in putting theoretical knowledge into practice some bit but I discovered that i'm not that into testing so the amount I learned would have been higher if I had more interest in it. I do however now posses some knowledge about software testing and the different stages and tools used in it. The final assignments instructions could have been more clearly put together, the multiple different files were confusing and it took a while to realize what to do with them.
